# KMNIST-Classification
Classifying handwritten digits 
- Several methods were used for classiÔ¨Åcation of the Kannada-MNIST handwritten digits applied. Among these methods, were deep learning techniques involving artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In addition machine learning algorithms like Random forest and Adaptive boost. CNNs are known and proven to be powerful image classifiers and so as expected the classification performance was the best out of all the attempted models.
- Model evaluation of the model we built using CNNs produced a loss value of 0.0287 and an accuracy score of 0.9952. Final score in the kaggle class competition was 0.97966
